XILINX AXI ETHERNET driver (xilinx_axienet)
--------------------------------------------------------

This driver supports following MAC configurations-
a) AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem.
b) 10G/25G High Speed Ethernet Subsystem.
c) 10 Gigabit Ethernet Subsystem.
d) USXGMII Ethernet Subsystem.

Management configuration is done through the AXI4-Lite interface.
The transmit and receive data interface is via the AXI4-Stream
interface connected to DMA controller. This driver supports Xilinx
AXI DMA and MCDMA DMA IP's. Programming sequence for these DMA IP's
is included in the xilinx_axienet driver.

For details about MDIO please refer phy.txt [1].

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be one of "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a" or
		  "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.01.a" or "xlnx,axi-ethernet-2.01.a"
		  for 1G MAC,
		  "xlnx,ten-gig-eth-mac" for 10 Gigabit Ethernet Subsystem,
		  "xlnx,xxv-ethernet-1.0" for 10G/25G MAC,
		  "xlnx,axi-2_5-gig-ethernet-1.0" for 2.5G MAC and
		  "xlnx,xxv-usxgmii-ethernet-1.0" for USXGMII.
- reg		: Address and length of the IO space, as well as the address
                  and length of the AXI DMA controller IO space, unless
                  axistream-connected is specified, in which case the reg
                  attribute of the node referenced by it is used.
- interrupts	: Should be a list of 2 or 3 interrupts: TX DMA, RX DMA,
		  and optionally Ethernet core. If axistream-connected is
		  specified, the TX/RX DMA interrupts should be on that node
		  instead, and only the Ethernet core interrupt is optionally
		  specified here.
- phy-handle	: See ethernet.txt [2].
- local-mac-address	: See ethernet.txt [2].
- phy-mode		: See ethernet.txt [2].
- axistream-connected	: Should contain phandle of DMA node.
- interrupt-parent	: Must be core interrupt controller.
Required properties (When AxiEthernet is configured with MCDMA):
- xlnx,channel-ids	: Queue Identifier associated with the MCDMA Channel.
- interrupt-names	: Should contain the interrupt names.

Optional properties:
- xlnx,rxmem		: Max Rx Memory size.
- xlnx,txcsum		: Tx checksum mode (Full, Partial and None).
- xlnx,rxcsum		: Rx checksum mode (Full, Partial and None).
- xlnx,phy-type		: Xilinx phy device type. See xilinx-phy.txt [3].
- dma-coherent		: Present if dma operations are coherent.
- xlnx,eth-hasnobuf	: Used when 1G MAC is configured in non-processor mode.
- clocks	: AXI bus clock for the device. Refer to common clock bindings.
		  Used to calculate MDIO clock divisor. If not specified, it is
		  auto-detected from the CPU clock (but only on platforms where
		  this is possible). New device trees should specify this - the
		  auto detection is only for backward compatibility.
- axistream-connected: Reference to another node which contains the resources
		       for the AXI DMA controller used by this device.
		       If this is specified, the DMA-related resources from that
		       device (DMA registers and DMA TX/RX interrupts) rather
		       than this one will be used.
 - mdio		: Child node for MDIO bus. Must be defined if PHY access is
		  required through the core's MDIO interface (i.e. always,
		  unless the PHY is accessed through a different bus).
- xlnx,rxtsfifo 	: Configures the axi fifo for receive timestamping.
- xlnx,include-dre	: Tells whether DMA h/w is configured with DRE or not.
- clocks		: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.
- clock-names		: Input clock names. Refer to IP PG for signal description.
			  1G/2.5G: s_axi_lite_clk, axis_clk and ref_clk.
			  10G/25G and USXGMII: s_axi_aclk, rx_core_clk and dclk.
			  10 Gigabit: s_axi_aclk and dclk.
			  AXI DMA and MCDMA: m_axi_sg_aclk, m_axi_mm2s_aclk and
			  m_axi_s2mm_aclk.

Optional properties (When AxiEthernet is configured with MCDMA):
- xlnx,num-queues	: Number of queues/channels configured in h/w.
Optional properties (When USXGMII is in use):
- xlnx,usxgmii-rate	: USXGMII PHY speed - can be 10, 100, 1000, 2500,
			  5000 or 10000.
Optional properties for connected DMA node:
- xlnx,addrwidth	: Specify the width of the DMA address space in bits.
			  Valid range is 32-64. Default is 32.

NOTE: Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) related DT bindings are explained in [4].
