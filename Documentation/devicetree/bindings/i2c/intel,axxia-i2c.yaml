description: |
  This implements I2C master functionality using the Intel Axxia API2
  controller.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: axxia,api2c

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: Offset and length of the register set for the device.

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1
    description: Should contain the SYSMEM controller IRQ.

  clocks:
    minItems: 1
    description: |
      I2C controller reference clock source. Must contain an entry for
      each name in clock-names.

  clock-names:
    items:
      - const: i2c

  clock-frequency:
    default: 400000
    description: |
      Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified, the
      default 100 kHz frequency will be used. As only Normal and Fast
      modes are supported, possible values are 100000 and 400000.

required:
  - compatible
  - "#address-cells"
  - "#size-cells"
  - reg
  - interrupts
  - clocks
  - clock-names
