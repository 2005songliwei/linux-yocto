Texas Instruments DRA72x CAMERA ADAPTATION LAYER (CAL)
------------------------------------------------------

The Camera Adaptation Layer (CAL) is a key component for image capture
applications. The capture module provides the system interface and the
processing capability to connect CSI2 image-sensor modules to the
DRA72x device.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 Should be "ti,dra72-cal", for DRA72 controllers
 Should be "ti,dra72-pre-es2-cal", for DRA72 controllers pre ES2.0
 Should be "ti,dra76-cal", for DRA76 controllers
- reg:	CAL Top level, Receiver Core #0, Receiver Core #1 and Camera RX
	control address space
- reg-names: cal_top, cal_rx_core0, cal_rx_core1 and camerrx_control
	     registers
- interrupts: should contain IRQ line for the CAL;
- ti,camerrx-control: phandle to the device control module and offset to
		      the control_camerarx_core register.
		      This node is meant to replace the "camerrx_control"
		      reg entry above but "camerrx_control" is still
		      handled for backward compatibility.

CAL supports 2 camera port nodes on MIPI bus. Each CSI2 camera port nodes
should contain a 'port' child node with child 'endpoint' node. Please
refer to the bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
	cal: cal@4845b000 {
		compatible = "ti,dra72-cal";
		reg = <0x4845B000 0x400>,
		      <0x4845B800 0x40>,
		      <0x4845B900 0x40>;
		reg-names = "cal_top",
			    "cal_rx_core0",
			    "cal_rx_core1";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		ti,camerrx-control = <&scm_conf 0xE94>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			csi2_0: port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				csi2_phy0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&csi2_cam0>;
					clock-lanes = <0>;
					data-lanes = <1 2>;
				};
			};
			csi2_1: port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
			};
		};
	};

	i2c5: i2c@4807c000 {
		clock-frequency = <400000>;

		camera-sensor@3c {
			compatible = "ovti,ov5640";
			reg = <0x3c>;

			clocks = <&clk_fixed>;
			clock-names = "xclk";

			port {
				csi2_cam0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&csi2_phy0>;
					clock-lanes = <0>;
					data-lanes = <1 2>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
